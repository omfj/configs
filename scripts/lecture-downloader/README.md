# Lecture Downloader

This folder includes two scripts for downloading lectures from two of UiB's
video services, Videonotat and Kaltura.

## How to use

**NOTE:** You can only use one of the programs at a time. Example: When you
have downloaded all of your Kaltura videos, you must delete all the links
from `lectures.txt`, and then you can fill it with Videonotat links
(and vice versa).

Find the video source in the networks tab using the developer tools in your
browser.

Paste all the links of the sources (videos) you want to download in
`lectures.txt`. Then just run the program and they should be downloaded
in the folder `output/`.
